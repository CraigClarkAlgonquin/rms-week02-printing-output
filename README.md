Task 1

Declare three variables, a and b and c.

If a has value 3, b has value 5, and c doesn't have a value, alert the following expressions ( one after another ). Alert popup box has to show the following content for each expression (concatenate everything in one long expression using "\n" to make new lines):

alert-1.png

Use the following template for each expression below:

// alert( "description of alerted_value: " + alerted_value );
/*
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a % b
a += 1
a -= 1
a *= b
a /= b
a %= b
a == b
a != b
a > b
a < b
!a && !c 
!a || !c 
*/
Task 2

Declare the variable first_name and assign it with the value of your first name;
Declare the variable last_name and assign it with the value of your last name;
Declare the variable email and assign it with the value of your email;
Declare the variable output;
Create the expression concatenating variables first_name, last_name, email and string literals needed to complete the sentence reading: "My name is Your-first-name Your-last-name. You can contact me at your-email@mail.com.";
Assign output with gotten expression;
Alert output.

Task 3

Here is the array containing random integers between 100 and 200:

var numbers = [
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100) + 100), 
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100) + 100), 
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100) + 100), 
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100) + 100), 
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100) + 100)
];
Add up the first and last element of the array.
Declare variable sum and assign it with value gotten by addition of the two array elements.
Check if sum is an even or an odd number.
If sum is an even number print the output confirming that, for example:

ss-even.png

If sum is an odd number print the output confirming that, for example:

ss-od.png

Submission

Create a GitHub Repository called "printing-output".

Add the gh-pages branch to the printing-output repo.

index.html has to be in the root of your repo.

Submit the link to your gh-pages rendered site.

Eg: https://abcd0001.github.io/printing-output/index.html

(Change the abcd0001 to your own username)

 

TEST your link to make sure it works before submitting the link.

Links that return a 404 error are worth zero.
